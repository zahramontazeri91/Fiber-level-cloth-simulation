This project consists of four steps. To run, tensorflow for GPU, python 3.5, Eigen and OpenCV is needed.
py/pipeline.py runs all the steps in order. 

1. First reading the input files which are simulation results
2. Generate the NN inputs. It reads the Deformation Gradients and based on the specified window size, it generates the local DG's for each window as NN input
3. NN from python is called. This returns the procedural values (4 values) for deformation of the cross-sections
4. Apply the NN output to the yarn in relax state

Note that in last step, we can generate the non-deformed version of the yarn-level as well as the deformed by changing c (compress) parameter
